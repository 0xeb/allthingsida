You have heard rumours that the diary of Madame de Maintenon contained the secrets to a legendary plot.
Good luck on your journey to uncovering the truth behind this mystery!

## CTF
You have heard that a rival historian recently discovered a copy of a chapter of the diary of Madame de Maintenon at the local library. But being unable to solve the mystery, returned it in frustration. Having long been fascinated by her history, you can't wait to investigate. What do you do?

## YOU
Head to the library

## CTF
You locate the section of the library where the diary was rumoured to have been stored, but its place is empty. After a few minutes browsing, you find it! A single page, but one that holds the key to a fascinating mystery.

The page reads:
_______________
21 October 1684

Dear Diary,

Today, an unsettling discovery came my way. A letter, it was, with ominous tidings of a plot against our cherished Louis XIV. The message was unlike any other, its meaning hidden behind unfamiliar symbols.

Within the letter lay a clue, 01000010, a piece of the puzzle. It hinted at more secrets, and I felt compelled to uncover them. But where to find the next piece?

Yours in devotion,

Madame De Maintenon

The page was lying on the shelf in the open, maybe it fell from somewhere. You see a few more loose pages sticking out of some other books around you. What happened here?

## YOU
Check books on the next shelf

## CTF
What luck! While going through the books on the next shelf over, you find another page stuck under them, similarly weathered to the first one. The message is hard to decipher due to it's age, but after some careful analysis you manage to decode it.

It reads:
_______________
24 October 1684

Beloved Diary,
 
As I delved into the code, a new piece surfaced, 00110111. It whispered of hidden truths, yet it also hinted that there was more to uncover. The puzzle remained incomplete.

Yours eternally,

Madame De Maintenon

Another clue, what could it mean? And where are the rest?

## YOU
Search the book for clues

## CTF
From the lack of dust on the book you found, it's clear these were recently borrowed. Maybe the pages got mixed up with the books when being reshelved?

You look up the name of the last borrower, and look up what other books they may have checked out. There you find the diary records mentioned, as well as one other book. 
Finding that book on the shelves yields another page!

_______________
30 October 1684

Dearest Diary,

Another fragment emerged, 10110010. It was a step closer to the full picture, but it also held a hint. The rest of the location, it suggested, was not far away.

Yours eternally,

Madame De Maintenon

## YOU
Turn over the page

## CTF
Turning the page over, you find the final entry to the diary!

9 November 1684

Beloved Diary,

Today, the last piece fell into place, 00000101. With it came the realization that the remaining location lay elsewhere, a mystery yet to be unraveled. Our mission is clear, my dear diary; we must decipher the rest to protect our homeland.

Yours in devotion,

Madame de Maintenon

What does this mean? You've worked so hard but yet still don't have the information you seek? What now?
You have all four pages your rival claimed to have found, and yet are no closer to the truth.
After several hours of fruitlessly searching for meaning in the messages, you give up and turn to leave in defeat.
