# Working with the Decompiler's Ctree in C++ and IDAPython: Learning with Examples

This repository contains resources and examples for the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/Qov-uBJCoqk) on working with the Decompiler's Ctree in C++ and IDAPython.

In this tutorial, we delve into how to:
- Walk the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) or Ctree.
- Inspect nodes within the Ctree.
- Identify and extract nodes of interest.
- Extract information from these nodes.

Starting with simple AST queries, we progressively move towards more complex and practical examples.
