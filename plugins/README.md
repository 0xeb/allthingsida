#  Plugins

This repository contains a collection of compact plugins designed to enhance productivity and automate tasks in IDA Pro. Due to their small size, they are housed together in this repository instead of being distributed across multiple repositories.

Other plugins have moved to their own individual repositories. You can find them here: [https://github.com/allthingsida](https://github.com/allthingsida).

## Util Hotkeys

[This plugin](./util_hotkeys/README.md) assigns shortcuts from "Ctrl-Alt-Shift-A" to "Z" in IDA Pro to placeholder functions, enabling easy customization of actions by replacing these functions with your own code.
