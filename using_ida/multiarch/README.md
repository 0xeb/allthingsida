# Handling multiple architectures in the same database in IDA

Ever wondered how to nicely disassemble embedded code or VM code/P-code of a different architectures than your input database in IDA?

In [this video](https://youtu.be/ukMDFMOF-tI), I show how we can nicely have an x86 database nicely disassemble ARMv8 and RISC-V shellcode. Then you should be able to add your comments, x-refs, etc.

Grab the input database and script to follow along.
